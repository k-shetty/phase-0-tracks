What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

HTML5 semantic tags are used to help structure content on HTML pages in a thoughtful manner while making it more accessible. Of the ones we had gone over today, I think <main> is a very useful tag since it makes the author really focus on placing the unique content for the page in that section. I think <section> is another useful tag since it has a lot of uses in HTML. 

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

From my understanding, I thought the browser wroks from top to bottom to properly display elements on a page. First is the doctype declaration, followed by checking the head to see if there is any additonal information needed to display elements listed in the body of the page. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

Creating and using snippets in Sublime is incredibly useful, and creating custom snippets is a realtively easy process. After today's GPS session, there are definitely more snippets I plan on creating for future use.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

I'm still very weak with visualing tables in HTML. Especialy when rowspan colspan start being used. I think working with tables in HTML more frequently should help me visualize tables better.
