<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>My name is Karan and this is the first time I've created a webpage. This is actually pretty cool. <strong>I cannot wait to learn more!</strong></p>

<strong>This is here to be bold!</strong>

<p><em>This is just a test to see what this looks like. I assume it italicizes text. Guess I was right!</em></p>

<p>These are things that you need to create your own webpage:</p>
<ol>
	<li>A computer</li>
	<li>Text editor</li>
	<li>Internet access</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some things about myself:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I was born in NYC</li>
	<li>I'm 25 years old</li>
	<li>My parents are from India</li>
</ul>
