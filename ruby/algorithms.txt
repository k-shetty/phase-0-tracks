#Elevator 

*First, Robot needs to know what floor to go to
*Robot would then check each button, starting with 1 (or lower levels if the elevator has them)
*Robot will stop once it reaches the correct number
*Robot will then press the button with the correct number on it

#Real-life algorithm

*One example of a real-life algorithm would be baking/cooking something following a recipe. You start with all the components separately and combine them together in a specific manner to produce the final product. For this example, the recipe is for chocolate chip cookies.

-Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F
-In a bowl combine eggs, sugar, butter and vanilla extract
-In a second bowl mix flour, baking soda, and salt.
-Add the contents to the second bowl to the first bowl while stirring
-Then add chocolate chips into the final mixture
-Scoop dough onto trays
-Place trays into oven
-Bake in oven for 20 minutes. 
-Remove trays from oven
-Cool for a few minutes
-Eat cookies
