# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool which allows the review of the entire history of revisions to one or more files and the merging of revisions made by different people. It is useful because with a list of revisions made, it is easier to keep track of who's making the revisisons and what revisions are being made. It also allows for a roll-back to a stable version if any recent changes introduced conflicts. In a similar regard, it also helps in tracking where certain bugs may have been introduced. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

From my understanding, a branch in git refers to Copy of the functional code you want to work with while preserving the funtional code. Branches are used to allow deveolpers to work on code without having to worry about introducing new bugs or conflicts to the original set of code. This means developers can focus on making changes without messing up the original.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit in git is essentially creating a save point or checkpoint. A good commit message should be a bit detailed as to what changes were made since the last commit (From what I've noticed, commit messages tend to be written in present tense. I'm not sure if that is something that is required for a commit message or not.)

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is an error that one recieves when merging two branches using git does not work properly. There seem to be different typed of merge conflicts based off of some cursory search on the subject. I actually ran into a edit collision when I was working on the assignemnt for branching it git, which is how I found out there were multiple causes for merge conflicts.
