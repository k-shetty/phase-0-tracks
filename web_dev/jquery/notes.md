First thing I would do would be is to check out the codecademy tutorial on jQuery. It was a useful tool for me when I first began to study Ruby. The great thing about codecademy is that its tutorials have small problems that need to be completed before moving on. This helps with pacing and taking breaks in between new information. 

After familiarizing myself with the syntax of jQuery, I'd look for some reference sheets to get a feel for the commonly used functions in jQuery.

Release 1

I spent close to 2 hours working on the lesson on jQuery on Codecademy. I took 10 minute breaks for every 30-40 minutes of studying. I feel like after the Codecademy tutorial, I'm better able to understand the basics of jQuery. This basic understanding also helped when I started to do a quick search for some reference material for jQuery. I was better able to read the documentation I came across after practicing with jQuery. I also really like having the console side-by-side next to the editor in Codecademy's website. It helped tremendously being able to see the changes happening as I was entering in text. 

Release 2

I plan on making a simple checklist using html, css, and jQuery (but jQuery will be doing most of the work.) I plan on using jQuery to allow the user to add tasks, make the text larger by hovering over the item added, changing the text color when the item is clicked, and removing the item from the list when the item is double-clicked.
