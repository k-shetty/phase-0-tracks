First thing I would do would be is to check out the codecademy tutorial on jQuery. It was a useful tool for me when I first began to study Ruby. The great thing about codecademy is that its tutorials have small problems that need to be completed before moving on. This helps with pacing and taking breaks in between new information. 

After familiarizing myself with the syntax of jQuery, I'd look for some reference sheets to get a feel for the commonly used functions in jQuery.
