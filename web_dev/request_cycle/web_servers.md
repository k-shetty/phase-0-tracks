What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

* Users are allowed to have complete control without the interference of a GUI. Because of this, users are expected to know how to work around the system. 
* Programs should be programmed to do one task well.
* Code is open-source.
* Programs should work well with others. 

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual server that is located on a remote server which can be accessed via the internet. VPS are ideal for small businesses or clients that would like to have the option to host a website, but lack the money for the hardware required to own and operate a dedicated server. VPS are also ideal tools to use as testing environments for updates before rolling them out onto the main server with the correctly functioning website. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running programs as the root user means no permissions are needed to execute any commands. This is a huge security flaw as it could allow unwanted changes to the OS.
